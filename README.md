# Most Dominant Colours in an Image using K-mean Clustering

## Overview:
This project utilizes K-means clustering to identify and extract the most dominant colours in an image. It offers a simple yet effective way to analyze and visualize the prominent colours present in an image.

## Features:
- *K-means Clustering:* Applies the K-means algorithm to group similar pixels and identify dominant colours.
- *Colour Extraction:* Extracts and presents the most dominant colours found in the image.
- *Visualization:* Visualizes the dominant colours through a variety of output formats.

## Parameters:

- image_path: Path to the input image file.
- k_clusters: Number of clusters for K-means (optional, default is 5).

## Requirements:
1. Python 3.x
2. OpenCV
3. NumPy
4. Matplotlib
5. Scikit-learn
